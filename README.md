# A-simple-Anime-news-Site
This is a solo project which has a bloging site type of layout but it focues on anime. I created this projected to test some of my front-end skills like grids and flex layouts

'index.css' and 'index.html' are the home page file 
'Aboue Me' containes the About me page
'Pages' contains files like 'Page 1' 'Page 2' and so on ... They are in the order they show up on the 'Home Page". <br>
They are the blogs that show up when you click on a blog
