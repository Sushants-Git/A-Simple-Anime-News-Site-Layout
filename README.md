# A-simple-Anime-news-Site
This is a solo project which has a bloging site type of layout but it focues on anime. I created this projected to test some of my front-end skills like grids and flex layouts

1. 'index.css' and 'index.html' are the home page files <br>
2. 'Aboue Me' containes the About me page files <br>
3. 'Pages' contains files like 'Page 1' 'Page 2' and so on ... They are in the order they show up on the 'Home Page". <br>
They contain the files for the 'blogs' themself <br>
They are the blogs that show up when you click on a blog <br>
